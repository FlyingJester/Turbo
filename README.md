About Turbo
-----------------

Turbo is a JavaScript environment for the desktop. It is primarily intended for games on other graphical and 
multimedia purposes, but it has all the facilities for general purpose programming as well. It aims to solve the 
same problems that Node.JS does, while being more cross-platform and supporting more processor architectures, and 
providing a lighter-weight scripting environment and more powerful interface.

The chief goal of Turbo is to let the programmer use JavaScript wherever they would otherwise use C, C++.

To do this, Turbo uses a direct scripting environment, rather than an event-driven one. You may still write 
event-driven code, but you have full access to the event loop.

Additionally, Turbo exposes a simple C++ API, coupled with SpiderMonkey's API, which allows you to write 
bindings for native libraries.
