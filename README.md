Where TurboSphere fell short, UltraSphere will prevail.

About UltraSphere
-----------------

UltraSphere is a JavaScript environment for the desktop. It solves the same problems that Node.JS does, while 
being more cross-platform and supporting more processor architectures, and providing a lighter-weight scripting 
environment and more powerful interface.

The chief goal of UltraSphere is to let the programmer use JavaScript wherever they would otherwise use C, C++.

To do this, UltraSphere uses a direct scripting environment, rather than an event-driven one. You may still write 
event-driven code, but you have full access to the event loop.

Additionally, UltraSphere exposes a simple C++ API, coupled with SpiderMonkey's API, which allows you to write 
bindings for native libraries.
